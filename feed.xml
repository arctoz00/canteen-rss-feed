      <title><![CDATA[HUB3: Monday | Lamb Biryani | Slow-braised lamb seasoned with warm Indian spices, served with brown rice, sweet mango chutney, and soft naan bread. | Vegetarian: Paneer Biryani – the same aromatic spice blend with fried pieces of Indian cheese, brown rice, mango chutney, and naan bread. | Tuesday | Swedish Meatballs | Juicy Swedish meatballs in a creamy sauce, served with rustic mashed potatoes, sweet-tart lingonberries, and freshly chopped parsley. | Vegetarian: Flavorful bean balls with the same creamy sauce, mashed potatoes, lingonberries, and freshly chopped parsley. | Wednesday | Falafel Wrap | Crispy falafels in warm flatbread, filled with pickled daikon and a fresh salad of mint, cucumber, and red onion, topped with a creamy, salted yogurt dressing. | Cake of the Day: Freshly baked lemon and poppy seed cake. | Thursday | Chicken in Tarragon Sauce | Tender chicken in a rich, creamy tarragon sauce, served with oven-roasted potatoes and a fresh green salad. | Vegetarian: Oven-baked eggplant stuffed with aromatic tomatoes and beans – served with the same tarragon sauce, roasted potatoes, and fresh salad. | Friday | Croque Madame | French toast with melted cheese, a fried egg, and a crisp bistro salad with vinaigrette. | Vegetarian: The same delicious version – just without ham, but still with gratinated cheese, fried egg, and bistro salad. |]]></title>
